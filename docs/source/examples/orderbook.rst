Orderbook as a Verifiable Service
=================================

This guide walks through transforming a simple centralized orderbook into a fully decentralized and verifiable service using the Zellular Sequencer.

We follow a progressive enhancement model, starting from a basic session-based FastAPI service, and incrementally evolving it into a replicated and cryptographically verifiable system.

Each step corresponds to a real implementation in the Zellular :src:`orderbook` directory.

Step 1: Centralized Orderbook Service
-------------------------------------

In this stage, we implement a basic in-memory orderbook service using FastAPI and session-based authentication. Users log in with a username and password, and can place buy/sell orders if they have sufficient balance. Submitted orders are either matched immediately or added to the orderbook.

ðŸ“„ File: :src:`orderbook/01_centralized_orderbook_service.py`

Key Concepts
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Session-based login using `SessionMiddleware`
- In-memory user balances per token (e.g., USDT, ETH)
- Buy/sell order schema with immediate price-based matching
- Orders are stored using `OrderWrapper` and sorted by price
- Partially filled or unmatched orders are added to the book

Endpoints
~~~~~~~~~

- `POST /login`: Log in with a username and password
- `GET /balance`: Check a user's token balance
- `GET /orders`: Retrieve all open orders
- `POST /order`: Submit a new buy or sell order

Order Schema
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Orders are submitted in the following format:

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "order_type": "buy",          // or "sell"
     "base_token": "ETH",
     "quote_token": "USDT",
     "quantity": 1.5,
     "price": 2000.0
   }

Only authenticated users can place orders.

Order Matching Logic
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When an order is submitted:

- The service checks that the user has sufficient balance:
  - For **buy**: `quote_token â‰¥ price Ã— quantity`
  - For **sell**: `base_token â‰¥ quantity`
- The order is passed to the `match()` function:
  - **Buy orders** match with the lowest-priced sell orders
  - **Sell orders** match with the highest-priced buy orders
- Trades update both users' balances (quote and base tokens)
- If the order is only partially filled, the remainder is added to the book

The orderbook is maintained using Pythonâ€™s `bisect.insort` for efficient price-based sorting.

Example Usage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. **Login**

.. code-block:: bash

   curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/login \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d '{"username": "user1", "password": "pass1"}' \
        -c cookies.txt

2. **Place an order**

.. code-block:: bash

   curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/order \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d '{
              "order_type": "buy",
              "base_token": "ETH",
              "quote_token": "USDT",
              "quantity": 1,
              "price": 2000
            }' \
        -b cookies.txt

3. **View all open orders**

.. code-block:: bash

   curl http://localhost:5001/orders

Testing with Script
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A helper script is provided for testing this centralized version of the orderbook:

ðŸ“„ File: :src:`orderbook/01_place_order.py`

This script:

- Logs in with a username/password
- Submits a sample order using the session cookie
- Prints the server response

To run it:

.. code-block:: bash

   python examples/orderbook/01_place_order.py

Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~

- Order matching is basic and does not use time-priority
- State (balances and orderbook) is stored in-memory only
- No cryptographic authentication or verifiability
- Service is centralized and not fault-tolerant

Next, weâ€™ll remove session-based login and introduce **signature-based authentication** using Ethereum-style keys.

Step 2: Signature-Based Orderbook Service
-----------------------------------------

In this step, we remove session-based login and introduce **stateless authentication using Ethereum-style signatures**. Users now sign order messages off-chain using their wallet's private key. The backend verifies the signature and uses the recovered address as the sender.

ðŸ“„ File: :src:`orderbook/02_signature_based_orderbook_service.py`

Key Concepts
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Stateless authentication using ECDSA signatures
- Each order includes a signed message
- The backend verifies the signature and derives the sender
- Orders are matched immediately upon submission

Message Format for Signing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Users must sign the following message string off-chain:

.. code-block:: text

   Order {order_type} {quantity} {base_token} at {price} {quote_token}

Example:

.. code-block:: text

   Order buy 1.5 ETH at 2000 USDT

Backend Verification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The server reconstructs the message and verifies the signature:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/orderbook/02_signature_based_orderbook_service.py
   :language: python
   :start-after: -- start: verifying signature --
   :end-before: -- end: verifying signature --

.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/orderbook/02_signature_based_orderbook_service.py
   :language: python
   :start-after: -- start: order request schema --
   :end-before: -- end: order request schema --

.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/orderbook/02_signature_based_orderbook_service.py
   :language: python
   :start-after: -- start: verifying when placing order --
   :end-before: -- end: verifying when placing order --


Testing with Script
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ðŸ“„ File: :src:`orderbook/02_place_order.py`

This script:

- Signs an order off-chain using a private key
- Sends it to the `/order` endpoint
- Demonstrates stateless interaction using a wallet-like client

Run it with:

.. code-block:: bash

   python examples/orderbook/02_place_order.py

Why This Matters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The service no longer requires login or session state
- Any node can independently verify the sender of an order
- Clients and servers interact in a stateless, cryptographically secure way
- This lays the foundation for distributed, multi-node replication

Next, weâ€™ll replicate the orderbook across nodes using the **Zellular Sequencer** to ensure all participants observe the same transaction order.

Step 3: Replicated Orderbook Service
------------------------------------

In this step, we replicate the orderbook across a network of nodes using the **Zellular Sequencer**. Instead of applying new orders immediately upon submission, each order is sent to the sequencer, which assigns it a global order and broadcasts it to all replicas.

Each node independently pulls the ordered sequence of operations and applies them locally, ensuring that the **orderbook and balances remain consistent** across all nodes.

ðŸ“„ File: :src:`orderbook/03_replicated_orderbook_service.py`

Key Concepts
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Orders are sent to the Zellular Sequencer via the SDK
- All nodes fetch and apply the same ordered batch of operations
- Order matching logic is executed identically on every node
- Ensures deterministic and consistent state replication

Order Submission
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Orders are received at the `/order` endpoint. After signature verification and basic balance check, they are submitted to the sequencer:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/orderbook/03_replicated_orderbook_service.py
   :language: python
   :start-after: -- start: submitting order to zellular --
   :end-before: -- end: submitting order to zellular --

This means the order will be processed once it appears in a sequenced batch.

Order Processing Loop
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each node runs a background thread to pull and apply new batches from Zellular:


.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/orderbook/03_replicated_orderbook_service.py
   :language: python
   :start-after: -- start: processing loop --
   :end-before: -- end: processing loop --

This ensures that all replicas receive and apply the same operations in the same order.

Why This Matters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Introduces true multi-node replication
- Guarantees consistent order matching and state across all nodes
- Enables fault-tolerant execution â€” any node can recover from sequenced history
- Prevents divergence even when nodes join or restart at different times

You now have a fully replicated, consistent, and **deterministic orderbook service** built with Zellular.

.. note::

   If you want to make balance queries in the orderbook verifiable, you can follow the same pattern explained in
   :ref:`signed-balance-token-service` and :ref:`verifiable-token-service` of the token example.

   This involves signing each balance response with a BLS key, allowing clients to verify
   that a node reported a specific value â€” useful for trustless withdrawals,
   cross-chain messaging, or secure offchain accounting.
